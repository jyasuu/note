Redis handles race conditions through a combination of its single-threaded architecture and concurrency control mechanisms. Here's a structured breakdown:

### 1. **Single-Threaded Execution**  
   - Redis processes commands sequentially in a single thread, ensuring **atomicity for individual operations** (e.g., `INCR`, `SET`, `LPUSH`). This eliminates race conditions for single commands since they cannot be interrupted.

### 2. **Transactions (`MULTI`/`EXEC`)**  
   - **Batching Commands**: Commands between `MULTI` and `EXEC` are queued and executed atomically, preventing interleaving with other clients' commands.  
   - **Limitation**: Transactions alone do not protect against external changes between queuing and execution (e.g., a key modified after `MULTI` but before `EXEC`).

### 3. **Optimistic Locking with `WATCH`**  
   - **Check-and-Set Workflow**:  
     1. Use `WATCH` to monitor keys for changes.  
     2. If a watched key is modified by another client before `EXEC`, the transaction aborts.  
     3. Retry the transaction on failure.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     WATCH balance
     balance = GET balance
     MULTI
     SET balance $new_value
     EXEC  # Fails if another client modified "balance" after WATCH
     ```

### 4. **Atomic Lua Scripting**  
   - Lua scripts run as a single atomic operation, blocking other commands during execution. Ideal for complex logic requiring uninterrupted execution.  
   - Example:  
     ```lua
     EVAL "local val = redis.call('GET', KEYS[1]); if val == ARGV[1] then redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[2]) end" 1 key expected_value new_value
     ```

### 5. **Pessimistic Locking (Client-Implemented)**  
   - Use Redis keys as **distributed locks** (e.g., `SETNX` or Redlock algorithm) to enforce exclusive access. Requires careful handling to avoid deadlocks.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     SET lock_key unique_id NX EX 10  # Acquire lock
     # Perform critical operations...
     EVAL "if redis.call('GET', KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then return redis.call('DEL', KEYS[1]) end" 1 lock_key unique_id  # Release lock
     ```

### Key Considerations  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - `WATCH`/`MULTI` for read-modify-write patterns (e.g., updating a counter).  
  - Lua scripts for complex atomic logic (e.g., conditional updates).  
  - Distributed locks for coarse-grained, long-running critical sections.  
- **Tradeoffs**:  
  - `WATCH` requires retry logic and may perform poorly under high contention.  
  - Lua scripts block the server during execution; keep them short.  

By leveraging these features, developers can mitigate race conditions effectively in Redis.
