The producer-consumer pattern in Go leverages goroutines and channels to efficiently manage concurrent data processing. Here's a concise implementation:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	const (
		numProducers     = 3
		numConsumers     = 5
		itemsPerProducer = 5
		channelBuffer    = 10
	)

	dataChan := make(chan int, channelBuffer)
	var wgProducers, wgConsumers sync.WaitGroup

	// Start producers
	for i := 0; i < numProducers; i++ {
		wgProducers.Add(1)
		go func(producerID int) {
			defer wgProducers.Done()
			for item := 0; item < itemsPerProducer; item++ {
				data := producerID*100 + item
				dataChan <- data
				fmt.Printf("Producer %d: %d\n", producerID, data)
			}
		}(i)
	}

	// Start consumers
	for i := 0; i < numConsumers; i++ {
		wgConsumers.Add(1)
		go func(consumerID int) {
			defer wgConsumers.Done()
			for data := range dataChan {
				fmt.Printf("Consumer %d: %d\n", consumerID, data)
			}
		}(i)
	}

	// Coordinate shutdown
	wgProducers.Wait()  // Wait for all producers to finish
	close(dataChan)     // Safe to close channel (no more sends)
	wgConsumers.Wait()  // Wait for consumers to process all data
}
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Channels:** 
   - `dataChan` buffers data between producers and consumers (`make(chan int, 10)`)

2. **Goroutines:**
   - **Producers:** Generate data concurrently, send to channel
   - **Consumers:** Process data concurrently using `range` over channel

3. **Synchronization:**
   - `sync.WaitGroup` coordinates graceful shutdown
   - Producers signal completion first
   - Channel closure triggers consumer exit
   - Consumers finish processing before program exits

**Pattern Characteristics:**
- Efficient resource utilization (parallel processing)
- Backpressure handling via channel buffering
- Clean shutdown coordination
- Decoupled production/consumption logic

**Execution Flow:**
1. Producers generate data and feed into channel
2. Consumers process data as it becomes available
3. When all producers finish â†’ channel closes
4. Consumers exit after processing all remaining data
5. Program exits when all goroutines complete

This pattern is ideal for batch processing, data pipelines, and any scenario requiring controlled concurrency.

Here's how to implement the producer-consumer pattern in Rust using both standard library features and the popular `crossbeam-channel` crate for comparison:

### 1. Using Standard Library (with limitations)
```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    const NUM_PRODUCERS: usize = 3;
    const NUM_CONSUMERS: usize = 5;
    const ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER: usize = 5;

    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
    let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Spawn producers
    for i in 0..NUM_PRODUCERS {
        let sender = sender.clone();
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER {
                let data = i * 100 + j;
                sender.send(data).unwrap();
                println!("Producer {}: {}", i, data);
            }
        }));
    }

    // Spawn consumers
    for i in 0..NUM_CONSUMERS {
        let receiver = Arc::clone(&receiver);
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            loop {
                let data = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();
                match data {
                    Ok(val) => println!("Consumer {}: {}", i, val),
                    Err(_) => break, // Channel closed
                }
            }
        }));
    }

    // Drop original sender to allow channel closure
    drop(sender);

    // Wait for all threads
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

### 2. Using crossbeam-channel (Recommended)
```rust
use crossbeam_channel::{unbounded, Sender, Receiver};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    const NUM_PRODUCERS: usize = 3;
    const NUM_CONSUMERS: usize = 5;
    const ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER: usize = 5;

    let (sender, receiver) = unbounded();
    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Spawn producers
    for i in 0..NUM_PRODUCERS {
        let sender = sender.clone();
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER {
                let data = i * 100 + j;
                sender.send(data).unwrap();
                println!("Producer {}: {}", i, data);
            }
        }));
    }

    // Spawn consumers
    for i in 0..NUM_CONSUMERS {
        let receiver = receiver.clone();
        handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            for data in receiver.iter() {
                println!("Consumer {}: {}", i, data);
            }
        }));
    }

    // Drop original sender and receiver
    drop(sender);
    drop(receiver);

    // Wait for all threads
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

**Key Components (crossbeam version):**

1. **Channels:**
   - `unbounded()` creates a multi-producer multi-consumer channel
   - Clones of `Sender` and `Receiver` can be shared across threads

2. **Threads:**
   - Producers send data through cloned senders
   - Consumers receive data through cloned receivers

3. **Synchronization:**
   - Automatic channel closure when all senders are dropped
   - `iter()` method exits cleanly when channel closes
   - Thread joining for proper cleanup

**Key Differences from Go:**

1. **Explicit Thread Management:**
   - Rust uses OS threads instead of lightweight goroutines
   - Requires explicit thread spawning and joining

2. **Ownership System:**
   - Channels implement clone semantics for shared access
   - Need to explicitly drop references for proper cleanup

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Explicit error handling for send/receive operations
   - Type-safe channel operations

**When to Use Which:**

1. **Standard Library:**
   - Good for simple single-producer scenarios
   - Limited to single consumer by default (needs `Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>` for multiple consumers)
   - Introduces contention in multi-consumer scenarios

2. **crossbeam-channel:**
   - Better for multi-producer/multi-consumer scenarios
   - More Go-like channel semantics
   - Higher performance in concurrent scenarios
   - Requires external dependency

**Performance Considerations:**

- `crossbeam-channel` typically outperforms standard library channels
- Unbounded channels can lead to memory bloat (use `bounded()` for backpressure)
- Standard library channels are good for simple thread communication

This pattern works well for:
- Parallel processing pipelines
- Event-driven architectures
- Work queue systems
- Real-time data processing

To compile the crossbeam version, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
crossbeam-channel = "0.5"
```
