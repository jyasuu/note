To help you learn the 26 key microservices design patterns, here's a structured breakdown grouped by categories, along with brief explanations:

---

### **1. Decomposition Patterns**  
1. **Decompose by Business Capability**  
   - Split services based on business functions (e.g., payments, inventory).  
2. **Decompose by Subdomain (DDD)**  
   - Align services with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) subdomains (e.g., Order, Customer).  
3. **Strangler Pattern**  
   - Gradually replace a legacy monolith by incrementally migrating features to microservices.  
4. **Bulkhead Pattern**  
   - Isolate failures by partitioning resources (e.g., thread pools, databases) per service.  

---

### **2. Integration & Communication Patterns**  
5. **API Gateway**  
   - Single entry point for clients to route requests, handle authentication, and aggregate responses.  
6. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**  
   - Create separate gateways tailored to specific client needs (e.g., mobile vs. web).  
7. **Service Discovery**  
   - Automatically detect service instances in dynamic environments (client- or server-side).  
8. **Circuit Breaker**  
   - Prevent cascading failures by halting requests to a failing service.  
9. **Asynchronous Messaging**  
   - Use message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for event-driven communication.  
10. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**  
    - Synchronous communication between services (e.g., gRPC, REST).  

---

### **3. Data Management Patterns**  
11. **Database per Service**  
    - Each service owns its database to ensure loose coupling.  
12. **Saga Pattern**  
    - Manage distributed transactions using sequences of local transactions with compensation.  
13. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
    - Separate read/write operations for scalability and performance.  
14. **Event Sourcing**  
    - Store state changes as a sequence of events for auditability and recovery.  
15. **API Composition**  
    - Aggregate data from multiple services (e.g., for queries spanning services).  
16. **Transactional Outbox**  
    - Reliably publish events via a database outbox table to avoid dual writes.  

---

### **4. Cross-Cutting Concerns**  
17. **Externalized Configuration**  
    - Store configurations (e.g., secrets, URLs) outside the code (e.g., Config Server).  
18. **Service Mesh**  
    - Decouple networking logic (retries, TLS) using sidecar proxies (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).  
19. **Sidecar Pattern**  
    - Attach helper containers to services for logging, monitoring, or network tasks.  
20. **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**  
    - Translate between bounded contexts to prevent domain model pollution.  

---

### **5. Observability & Monitoring**  
21. **Log Aggregation**  
    - Centralize logs (e.g., ELK Stack) for debugging and analysis.  
22. **Distributed Tracing**  
    - Track requests across services (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).  
23. **Health Check API**  
    - Expose endpoints to monitor service availability.  
24. **Metrics Collection**  
    - Track performance metrics (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).  

---

### **6. Deployment & Testing**  
25. **Blue-Green Deployment**  
    - Deploy updates to a parallel environment and switch traffic with zero downtime.  
26. **Consumer-Driven Contract Testing**  
    - Ensure services meet consumer expectations using contract tests (e.g., Pact).  

---

### **Bonus Patterns**  
- **Canary Release**: Gradually roll out updates to a subset of users.  
- **Gateway Aggregation**: Combine multiple requests into one to reduce client chattiness.  
- **Self-Contained Systems (SCS)**: Services bundle UI, logic, and data for autonomy.

### **How to Learn Effectively**  
1. **Start Small**: Focus on foundational patterns like API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, and Database per Service.  
2. **Experiment**: Use tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot to implement patterns.  
3. **Case Studies**: Explore how companies like Netflix (Circuit Breaker) and Uber (Event Sourcing) use these patterns.  
4. **Books/Resources**:  
   - *"Microservices Patterns"* by Chris Richardson.  
   - Martin Fowlerâ€™s blog on microservices.
