Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a common issue when `curl` fails with:

```
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

while the browser works fine.
Browsers maintain their own trusted CA stores and often handle intermediate certs more gracefully than `curl` (which depends on system CA bundles).

### üß∞ Tools & Methods to Analyze ‚Äúcurl (60)‚Äù SSL Errors

Here are reliable tools and approaches to pinpoint *why* the chain fails:

---

#### **1. `openssl s_client`**

Best low-level way to see the certificate chain.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts
```

Then look for:

* Whether **intermediate certs** are missing.
* Whether the **issuer** matches any **trusted root**.
* The `Verify return code: 0 (ok)` line ‚Äî non-zero means cert verification failed.

To test with system trust store:

```bash
openssl s_client -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect example.com:443
```

To test with specific CA bundle used by curl:

```bash
openssl s_client -CAfile /etc/ssl/cert.pem -connect example.com:443
```

---

#### **2. `curl -vI` with Debug Info**

Shows exactly which cert curl is using and why it fails:

```bash
curl -vI https://example.com
```

If the output includes:

```
SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

‚Üí Intermediate or root CA missing in `curl`‚Äôs CA store.

---

#### **3. `sslscan` (CLI)**

Comprehensive scan tool (Linux package `sslscan`):

```bash
sslscan https://example.com
```

Shows cert chain, expiration, supported protocols, and cipher suites.

---

#### **4. `sslyze` (Python)**

Advanced analysis:

```bash
pip install sslyze
sslyze --certinfo=full example.com
```

Reports chain completeness, expiry, and trust validation per CA store.

---

#### **5. Online analyzers**

If you just need a quick visual check:

* üîó [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
* üîó [ImmuniWeb SSLScan](https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/)
* üîó [Hardenize](https://www.hardenize.com/)

These sites show whether intermediate certs are correctly configured and what browsers vs. curl see.

### ü©∫ Common Root Causes

| Problem                        | Why Browser Works             | Why Curl Fails                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Missing intermediate CA        | Browser auto-fetches from AIA | Curl doesn‚Äôt auto-fetch          |
| Wrong server chain order       | Browser repairs order         | Curl validates strictly          |
| Old CA bundle on server/client | Browser updated bundle        | Curl uses stale `/etc/ssl/certs` |
| Custom proxy or MITM cert      | Browser trusts via OS store   | Curl doesn‚Äôt know it             |

---

### ‚úÖ Quick Fix for Testing

If you only want to confirm it‚Äôs a chain issue:

```bash
curl -vk https://example.com --cacert <(openssl s_client -showcerts -connect example.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | awk '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/')
```

This lets curl use the chain it fetched directly ‚Äî if it then succeeds, your system CA bundle is missing an intermediate.
