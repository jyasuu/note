To practice the MinIO Presigned URL Upload Pattern, follow these steps. We'll cover both generating presigned URLs and using them for uploads/downloads.

### 1. MinIO Setup (Prerequisites)
- **Run MinIO Server** (Docker example):
  ```bash
  docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
  ```
- Access Console: `http://localhost:9001` (login: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)
- Create bucket: `test-bucket`

---

### 2. Python Script for Presigned URLs
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install minio requests
```

#### Script (`minio_presigned.py`):
```python
from minio import Minio
from minio.error import S3Error
import requests

# MinIO server config
ENDPOINT = "localhost:9000"
ACCESS_KEY = "minioadmin"
SECRET_KEY = "minioadmin"
BUCKET = "test-bucket"
FILE_NAME = "example.txt"  # File to upload/download

# Initialize client
client = Minio(
    endpoint=ENDPOINT,
    access_key=ACCESS_KEY,
    secret_key=SECRET_KEY,
    secure=False  # Set True for HTTPS
)

def generate_presigned_upload():
    try:
        # Generate presigned PUT URL (expires in 1 hour)
        presigned_url = client.presigned_put_object(
            bucket_name=BUCKET,
            object_name=FILE_NAME,
            expires=3600  # 1 hour
        )
        print(f"Presigned Upload URL: {presigned_url}")
        return presigned_url
    except S3Error as e:
        print(f"MinIO Error: {e}")
        return None

def upload_via_presigned(url):
    # Sample file content (replace with actual file)
    file_content = b"Hello MinIO Presigned URL!"
    
    # Upload using PUT request
    response = requests.put(url, data=file_content, headers={"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Upload successful!")
    else:
        print(f"Upload failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

def generate_presigned_download():
    try:
        # Generate presigned GET URL (expires in 15 mins)
        return client.presigned_get_object(BUCKET, FILE_NAME, expires=900)
    except S3Error as e:
        print(f"Download URL error: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate and use upload URL
    upload_url = generate_presigned_upload()
    if upload_url:
        upload_via_presigned(upload_url)
    
    # Generate download URL
    download_url = generate_presigned_download()
    print(f"\nDownload URL: {download_url}\n")
    # Access this URL in browser/curl to download
```

### 3. Key Steps Explained
1. **Initialize MinIO Client**:
   - Configure with endpoint and credentials
   - Use `secure=False` for local HTTP (set `True` for production HTTPS)

2. **Generate Presigned PUT URL**:
   - `presigned_put_object()` creates a time-limited URL for uploads
   - Specify bucket, object name, and expiration time

3. **Upload via Presigned URL**:
   - Use HTTP `PUT` method with the URL
   - Include file data in the request body
   - Set `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`

4. **Generate Presigned GET URL**:
   - `presigned_get_object()` creates a URL for downloads
   - Same bucket/object, typically shorter expiration

---

### 4. Testing Workflow
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python minio_presigned.py
   ```
   Output will show:
   - Upload URL (valid 1 hour)
   - Download URL (valid 15 minutes)

2. **Manual Upload Test (curl)**:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -T path/to/local-file.txt "http://<PRESIGNED_UPLOAD_URL>"
   ```

3. **Verify in MinIO Console**:
   - Check `test-bucket` for uploaded files
   - Access download URL in browser

---

### 5. Security Notes
- **Short Expiration**: Presigned URLs are time-limited (adjust `expires` as needed)
- **Bucket Permissions**: Ensure bucket has write/read access policies
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid exposing presigned URLs in logs

---

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **403 Forbidden**: Check bucket permissions/expiration time
- **Connection Error**: Verify MinIO server is running
- **Invalid Endpoint**: Use IP/DNS without `http://` in the client
- **Missing File**: Ensure the object name matches during upload/download

This pattern is ideal for:
- Client-side direct uploads (web/mobile apps)
- Temporary access without exposing credentials
- Serverless architectures (offload uploads to clients)

Let me know if you'd like to extend this to multipart uploads or browser JavaScript examples!
