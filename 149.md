I'll help you compare these three search technologies. Here's how they relate to each other and their key differences:

**Solr and Lucene**

Solr is built *on top of* Lucene. Lucene is a core Java library that provides the fundamental indexing and searching capabilities, while Solr wraps Lucene with additional features and presents it as a standalone search server that you can query over HTTP/REST APIs. If you're building a Java application and want to embed search functionality directly, Lucene is your choice. If you want a separate server you can query over the network, Solr is the better option.

**Elasticsearch**

Elasticsearch is also built on Lucene under the hood, but it takes a different architectural approach. Rather than being a traditional search server like Solr, Elasticsearch is designed as a distributed, scalable search and analytics platform. It was built from the ground up with horizontal scaling, clustering, and real-time analytics in mind.

**Key Comparisons**

*Architecture*: Lucene is a library, Solr is a server application, and Elasticsearch is a distributed platform with built-in clustering. Elasticsearch makes horizontal scaling and multi-node deployments much easier out of the box.

*Ease of Use*: Elasticsearch has a gentler learning curve for many developers and comes with better default configurations. Solr is more powerful once configured but requires more setup. Lucene requires the most expertise since you're integrating it into your own code.

*Community and Adoption*: Elasticsearch has the largest and most active community currently. Solr has a mature, stable community but smaller. Lucene has the smallest direct user base since most people use it through Solr or Elasticsearch.

*Scaling*: Elasticsearch is purpose-built for distributed systems and scales horizontally with minimal configuration. Solr requires more manual configuration for clustering. Lucene doesn't natively support distribution since it's a library.

*Real-time Features*: Elasticsearch excels at real-time search and analytics with its near real-time refreshes. Solr can do this but requires more configuration. Lucene supports it but you manage it yourself.

*Licensing*: Lucene and Solr are open-source under Apache licenses. Elasticsearch uses a proprietary license for newer versions (though older versions were open-source), which affects commercial use.

*Use Cases*: Choose Lucene if you're embedding search in a Java app. Choose Solr if you need a powerful, flexible search server with strong control. Choose Elasticsearch for modern distributed search, logging (via the ELK stack), and analytics platforms.
