Rust's **zero-cost abstractions** mean that high-level programming constructs (like traits, generics, closures, iterators, etc.) compile down to machine code that is **as efficient as equivalent low-level, hand-written code**. You get the expressiveness and safety of abstractions without runtime performance penalties.  

### Key Principles:
1. **"What you don’t use, you don’t pay for."**  
   Unused features add no runtime overhead (e.g., generics compile to monomorphized code only for types actually used).

2. **"What you do use, you couldn’t hand-code any better."**  
   Abstractions like iterators or `Option`/`Result` compile to optimal assembly—often matching manual implementations.

### Examples:
- **Iterators vs. `for` loops**:  
  ```rust
  // High-level iterator
  let sum: u32 = vec![1, 2, 3].iter().sum();
  ```
  Compiles to the same machine code as a manual loop with bounds-checking elided.

- **Generics (Monomorphization)**:  
  ```rust
  fn add<T>(a: T, b: T) -> T where T: std::ops::Add { ... }
  ```
  The compiler generates specialized versions of `add` for each concrete type (e.g., `add_i32`, `add_f64`), avoiding runtime type checks.

- **`Option`/`Result` enums**:  
  These use **niche optimization** (e.g., `None` represented as `0` for pointers), making them as efficient as raw pointers or error codes.

---

### Why It Matters:
- **Performance**: Abstractions don’t introduce runtime indirection (e.g., no garbage collection, dynamic dispatch by default).
- **Safety**: Memory safety, bounds checks, and error handling are enforced at compile time, not runtime.
- **Expressiveness**: Write clean, maintainable code without sacrificing speed.

Rust achieves this through aggressive compile-time optimizations (monomorphization, inlining, etc.), ensuring abstractions "disappear" in the final binary. This philosophy, inspired by C++, is core to Rust’s design.
