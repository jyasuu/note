Absolutely, Leo. Given your deep expertise in PostgreSQL internals, let‚Äôs frame SQL in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) with a diagnostic lens‚Äîespecially around how it differs from PostgreSQL in execution and optimization.

### üß† What SQL Means in MSSQL

SQL in MSSQL is primarily implemented through **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**, Microsoft‚Äôs proprietary extension to standard SQL. It adds procedural programming features like:
- `BEGIN...END` blocks
- `WHILE`, `IF`, `TRY...CATCH`
- Local variables (`DECLARE`, `SET`)
- System functions (`@@ROWCOUNT`, `@@ERROR`, etc.)

### üîç Query Execution & EXPLAIN Equivalent

In MSSQL, the equivalent of PostgreSQL‚Äôs `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is:

```sql
SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON;
-- or
SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON;
-- or
SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON;
```

These options reveal:
- Estimated and actual execution plans
- Logical and physical operators (e.g., Nested Loops, Hash Match)
- I/O cost, CPU time, and row estimates

You can also use **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to view graphical execution plans with tooltips showing operator cost breakdowns.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Indexing & Optimization Nuances

MSSQL indexing strategies differ in some key ways:
- **Clustered Indexes**: Every table can have one; it defines the physical order of data.
- **Non-Clustered Indexes**: Similar to PostgreSQL‚Äôs B-tree, but can include `INCLUDE` columns for covering queries.
- **Filtered Indexes**: Like partial indexes in PostgreSQL.
- **Full-Text Indexes**: For fuzzy matching, though not as flexible as `pg_trgm`.

MSSQL also supports **Columnstore Indexes** for analytics workloads‚Äîakin to PostgreSQL‚Äôs `cstore_fdw`.

### üß™ Diagnostic Example

Here‚Äôs a simple query and how you‚Äôd analyze it:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customers WHERE city = 'Taipei';
```

To inspect performance:

```sql
SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON;
GO
SELECT name FROM Customers WHERE city = 'Taipei';
GO
```

This gives you:
- Logical reads per table
- CPU time
- Execution time

You can then correlate this with the execution plan to identify missing indexes or suboptimal joins.
